# Abigen

The `abigen` command generates bindings to interact with smart contracts using Go. It requires as input the ABI specification of the smart contract in JSON format.

## Usage

```shell
$ ethgo abigen --source ./erc20.json --package erc20
```

## Options

- `source`: Path of the ABI contract file.
- `package`: Name of the Go package.
- `output`: Output directory. It defaults to the current location.

## Output

It generates two output files.

- `[name].go`: It contains the bindings for the contract.
- `[name]_artifacts.go`. It contains the artifacts for the contract (ABI and deploy binary).

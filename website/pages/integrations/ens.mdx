# Ethereum Name Service (ENS)

The Ethereum Name Service ([ENS](https://ens.domains/)) is a distributed, open, and extensible naming system based on the Ethereum blockchain.

The <GoDocLink href="">ENS</GoDocLink> object on the `ens` package is a module that abstracts the interaction with the ENS registry.

```go
package main

import (
    "github.com/umbracle/ethgo/ens"
)

func main() {
	ensMod, err := ens.NewENS(ens.WithAddress("https://mainnet.infura.io"))
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
}
```

It will default to `0x00000000000C2E074eC69A0dFb2997BA6C7d2e1e` as the address for the ENS registry when connecting with one of the official Ethereum networks. However, this can be parametrized at creation time. This module also requires a JsonRPC connection to make the calls to the ENS registry contract.

## Options

- <GoDocLink href="ens#WithAddress">WithAddress</GoDocLink>: JsonRPC url of the endpoint to connect with.
- <GoDocLink href="ens#WithClient">WithClient</GoDocLink>: [`JsonRPC`](/jsonrpc) object to make rpc calls. It takes preference over an address from `WithAddress`.
- <GoDocLink href="ens#WithResolver">WithResolver</GoDocLink>: Custom resolver address to use rather than the default one.

## Resolve

<GoDocLink href="ens#ENS.Resolve">Resolve</GoDocLink> resolves an ENS name to its registered address.

```go
ensMod.Resolve("umbracle.eth")
```

Input:

- `name` (string): ENS name to resolve.

Output:

- `address` <Address/>: Ethereum address that resolves to the input name.
